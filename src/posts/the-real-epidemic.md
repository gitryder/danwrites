Did you know that there is a disease, perhaps, even deadlier than the
Coronavirus? It's called 'Unreasonable Comparison'. This disease causes you to
compare yourself to others baselessly and conjecture that you are good for
nothing. This disease doesn't kill you, _it makes you kill yourself (at least,
metaphorically)_.

There's no vaccine for this yet. The only antidote is speaking about it openly,
so let's talk about it.

## Insecurity

Insecurity is this state of feeling unaccomplished. It is to look at your peers
(or others) around you and think that everyone is better than you at everything
and you're the only one that knows absolutely nothing.

I've been there too. It is bad. Really Bad. It's the feeling that you're not
going to make it because you're not as "good" as your peers

I've seen this problem in my college as well. I see people have questions about
many things, but they won't ask. And it's not that they don't want answers -
they just don't want to feel vulnerable. They'd rather not ask, than become the
laughing stock.

Insecurity is a weird feeling because it lessens your worth in your own eyes.
You might sometimes falsely believe that you're not good enough. But I am here
to tell you otherwise.

## Why it happens

It's easier to answer why it happens if you first answer who it happens to.

This feeling happens mostly to people that think lowly of themselves. It's a
self-esteem problem. We, as social beings, incorrectly judge personal progress
relatively.

Take it from [Morgan Housel](https://www.google.com/search?q=morgan+housel) from
his book "The Psychology of Money" -

> We tend to judge wealth by what we see because that's the information we have
> in front of us. We can't see people's bank accounts or brokerage statements.
> So we rely on outward appearances to gauge financial success. Cars. Homes.
> Instagram photos.

Morgan speaks about finances here, but this can be applied to virtually
everything - even tech.

We might look at different people on Twitter or even your classmates learning
language X and creating project Y and doing this and that. Now we only have the
information which is in front of us - the project, the technologies used, etc.,
and you might judge competence based on these things, which isn't really fair.

We've not seen Edison try and fail, we've only seen the product he finished.

## Curing insecurity

> There is always someone out there getting better than you by training harder
> than you - Pelé

And this one simple line completely changed the way I think about myself.

The cure to insecurity is simpler than we think. It is to realize that no matter
where we are, what we do, and how we do it, there is always going to be someone
better than us, training harder than us.

So does this mean that you should just completely give up and not do anything?

No, it means that you ~~can~~ should stop comparing yourself to others
baselessly - unless the person you're comparing your life and progress to, lives
in the same house as you, lives in the same environment as you do, eats the same
things, wears the same things, has the same friends, has the same attitude and
same outlook on life, goes to the same places as you do, meets the same people
etcetera

This is also how I cured my insecurity. When I thought deeply about it, I
realized that I was spending so much time thinking about how well others are
doing, that I didn't have time to do the things that would help me make
progress.

I realized that I am a different person, I have different goals, I have
different desires and just because someone's learning the latest and greatest
programming language and it's working for them, doesn't mean it will work for me

And the same goes for you. Find what _you_ love and do that instead, don't do
something just because someone else is doing it. Train your mind to be happy for
others when they succeed and to not begin comparing yourself.

~~

I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. I've personally
struggled with insecurity (impostor syndrome) and I hope I was able to help you
understand it better and hopefully help you take action and solve this problem
once and for all.

Thanks for reading! 💖
