Chadash is a Hebrew word that means to renew or to repair. It is also, by no
coincidence, the name of my (currently unregistered) company - Chadash Labs.

I love learning new things, building new things, and teaching the things I've
learned along the way.

My philosophy on life is simple - Skill puts you in the presence of kings; be
extraordinarily skilled and ~~if possible~~, help others along the way. And
being skilled requires one to be at the edge of one's craft.

I strive to be at the edge of my craft as often as possible. Am I perfect? By no
means. But do I have to be? Certainly not. I only need to learn (at least) ten
new things every day and figure out how to use those things to improve my life
and systems.

And even though the things I learn might be subjective, I'm sure there's
something everyone can learn from each other. Besides,
[this](https://dkb.io/post/write-it-anyway) blog post motivated me more than
enough to start writing & put my thoughts out there.

So I spun this blog up over the weekend with the intent of posting about all the
things I love talking about - Tech., Investing, English Vocabulary & more.

I plan to pilot this train, and if you think what I write about interests you,
why not join the bandwagon and learn and grow together.

Wear your favorite shoes, hop on and let's get this started.
