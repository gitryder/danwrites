Chadash is a Hebrew word that means to renew or to repair.

I love learning new things, building new things, and teaching the things I've
learned along the way.

My take on life is simple - skill puts you in the presence of kings; be
extraordinarily skilled and ~~if possible~~, help others along the way. And
being skilled requires one to be at the edge of one's craft.

I strive to be at the edge of my craft as often as possible. Am I perfect? By no
means. But do I have to be? Certainly not. I only need to learn (at least) ten
new things every day and figure out how to use those things to improve my life
and systems.

And even though the things I learn might be subjective, I'm sure there's
something everyone can learn from each other (if these things are
well-documented).

Besides, [this](https://dkb.io/post/write-it-anyway) blog post motivated me
enough to start writing & put my thoughts out there.

And what better way than a blog can there be to post about all the things I love
talking about - Tech., Investing, English Vocabulary & General thoughts and
Observations.

So, 2 days and ~83 git commits later 👨‍💻, this shiny blog site is good to go!

I plan to pilot this train of knowledge-sharing 🚂, and if you think what I
write about interests you, why not join the bandwagon and learn and grow
together.

This is a Chadash journey. Wear your favorite shoes, hop on and let's get this
started 🙏.
